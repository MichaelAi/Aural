# AuralPlayer
A simple Windows 10 modern music player.

Aural Player is a simple windows 10 music. What simple means? It means there is no library management, no tag editor, no artwork downloader, nothing but a playlist and a player.

This app is developed as a personal hobby - for fun and to learn git - but everyone can contribute if they want. It was inspired by the lack of simple, good looking apps in the windows store. The name is not final and might change (though i quite like it).

Currently supported features:

- Drag and drop files to playlist

- System media control integration

- File association

- Sorting

- Searching playlist


Future features:

- Playlist saving and loading

- Who knows?

This repository has been recreated as i somehow corrupted the previous one.
